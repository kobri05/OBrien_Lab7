For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related data sets to solve a murder mystery!

# Part 1: GitHub Workflow

At the top of the document (in the YAML) there is an `author` line that says 
`"Your name here!"`. Change this to be your name and save your file either by
clicking on the blue floppy disk or with a shortcut (command / control + s). 

Be sure to [commit the files to your repo](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first#stage-and-commit). 

Let's get started!


# Part 2: Some Words of Advice

-   Set chunk options carefully.

-   Make sure you don't print out more output than you need.

-   Make sure you don't assign more objects than necessary---avoid "object junk"
in your environment.

-   Make your code readable and nicely formatted.

-   Think through your desired result **before** writing any code.

# Part 3: Finding the Killer

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database
skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different
pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins,
driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in **all** of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or
remove this! Take some time to look at each file type so that 

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcanner/stat_210_2025_website/main/labs/instructions/lab-7-setup.R")
```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!


**Step 1: Find the police report in `crime_scene_report`. Then used the information in the report to move on to the next data source based on the information learned.**
##Making a 'Relevant Crime' Data Set.
```{r}
# Code for looking at the relevant crime scene report.
#| label: find relevant crime scenes
relevant_crime <- crime_scene_report|>
  filter(type == 'murder') |>
  filter(city == "SQL City") |>
  select(description) |>
  distinct(description) |>
  slice_tail() |>
  print()
  
```




**Next Steps: Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
There are accomplices, some knowingly and some unknowingly, but there is only one mastermind.

##Find witnesses

```{r}
#| label: find people 'Annabel'
person |>
  filter(address_street_name == "Franklin Ave") |>
  filter(str_detect(name, "Annabel")) #https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf

```

```{r}
#| label: find Northwestern Dr resident

person |>
  filter(address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr") |>
  arrange(desc(address_number)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

##Find interviews from witnesses
```{r}
#| label: Witness interviews

interview |>
  filter(person_id %in% c("14887", 
                          "16371"))
```

## Find info about suspect
> Given the info that our suspect had a "Get Fit Now  Gym" bag with a member number that started with 48z and license plate that has H42W, and that he was at the gym on Jan 9th, I need to manipulate the get fit now check ins, member numbers, and drivers' licenses to find a suspect

```{r}
#| label: Find leads for suspect
gfn_membership_info <- rename(get_fit_now_check_in, 
                              id = membership_id)|>
left_join(get_fit_now_member, 
          get_fit_now_check_in, 
          by = "id")

gfn_membership_info |>
  mutate(check_in_date = ymd(check_in_date)) |>
  filter(check_in_date == "2018-01-09") |>
  filter(str_detect(id, "48Z"))

```

```{r}
#| label: Find license IDs/driver's info about people found above
drivers_license <- drivers_license |>
  rename(license_id = id)

person_license <- left_join(drivers_license, 
                            person)

person_license |>
  select(plate_number, 
         name) |>
  filter(str_detect(plate_number, 
                    "H42W")) |>
  filter(name == "Jeremy Bowers")

```



Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your
document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the
tables manually. Functions from `stringr` and `lubridate` will also be useful.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.
